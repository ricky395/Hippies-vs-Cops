# Hippies-vs-Cops

This project is not finished.

I uploaded a code sample of sprites movement and attack inside this game. You can play the game here https://justapear.itch.io/hippies-vs-cops.

The 'SpriteMovement' script makes the movement of every sprite possible, and the 'AttackScript' handles the attack of every unit to their enemies. More details in the .cs file commented lines.
